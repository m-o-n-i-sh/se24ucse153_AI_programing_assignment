**Architecture for a Turing Test System**
To determine whether the entity interacting with the system is human or artificial intelligence based on conversation.
**Main Components**
1. User Interface Module
2. Conversation Manager
3. Question Generator
4. Response Analyzer
5. Decision Engine
6. Database / Knowledge Base
